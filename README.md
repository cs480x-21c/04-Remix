# Assignment 4 - DataVis Remix + Multiple Views

[Visualization Hosted on GitHub Pages](https://jalovering.github.io/04-Remix/)

# Visualization Description
This project was a remix on a [visualization hosted on the U.S. Energy Information Administration webpage](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/browser/#/topic/0?agg=2,0,1&fuel=vvg&geo=g&sec=g&linechart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.M&columnchart=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.COW-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NG-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.NUC-US-99.M~ELEC.GEN.HYC-US-99.M&map=ELEC.GEN.ALL-US-99.M&freq=M&start=200101&end=202012&chartindexed=0&ctype=linechart&ltype=pin&rtype=s&maptype=0&rse=0&pin=).

The original visualization displays the net generation, in thousand megawatthours, of coal, natural gas, nuclear, and conventional hydroelectric energy. This is a very well made visualization, including tooltips, customizable range, as well as a linked table of individual values. I created a new version of this vis with the goal to summarize the results by year and clearly show proportional differences between each energy type through a linked barplot. 

The remixed version of this visualization is displayed below:
