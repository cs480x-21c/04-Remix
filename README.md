Description

For this project, I found an original VIS on r/dataisbeautiful that shows the average median income (by week) in the United States by Sex and Ethnicity.
For my remix, I decided to create an interactive linked-vis with a scatter plot, and multi-line graph in D3.
The legend is the interactivity part of the vis, where selecting a sex (Men, Women, Both Sexes) in either graphs
hides all other data points not of that type.
